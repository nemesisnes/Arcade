# Arcade
Added the wheel just in case you guys don't have Arcade. You can also check out https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade to get the latest install base.
Make sure that you have arcade installed on which ever editor you use to run Python, if not the files in this repository will not work. 
Solitaire works independantly so you don't need to much to run it.
Space Defense Force is a work inprogress title, that will eventually have enemies, levels, power-ups and such. 
This build you'll be able to shoot meteors with the 1 or 2 keys. IF there is lag when you first fire I'm working on it.
Up and down keys are to thrust the ship forward and backward, and the left and right arrow keys turn the ship.
Added a game over sequence so that you can restart the game, will add a full on quit feature later.
This build is open source for now, so edit and add as you please.
