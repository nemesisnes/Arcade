# Arcade
This is a first try with Python Arcade. 
Work in progress solitaire game that will feature other variants of the solitaire at a later time.
Please feel free to use, edit, and contribute if you so please.
The Arcade will be constantly updated as I progress in building this, so bare with me.
If you're using Python, make sure you get arcade from PyPI.org
Thanks for checking out my work, and keep rocking baby!
