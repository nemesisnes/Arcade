# Arcade
This is a first try with Python Arcade. 
Work in progress solitaire game that will feature other variants of the solitaire at a later time.
Please feel free to use, edit, and contribute if you so please.
Please view the files that have .md on them in the image folders. They contain pertinent information to help those who wish to use other card sizes.
If you're using Python, make sure you get arcade from PyPI.org
Thanks for checking out my work, and keep rocking baby!
